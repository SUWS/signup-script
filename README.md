# signup-script
BASH script for logging registrations at the bunfight. Simple, but effective!

# Installation
This script doesn't need much installation -- simply clone the repo and run it. Depends on figlet, but the figlet output could be hardcoded if necessary (or removed entirely)
* `git clone https://github.com/SUWS/signup-script`
* `cd signup-script`
* `./signup.sh`
